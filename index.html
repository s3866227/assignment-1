            My name is Chloé Kingma (student number, s3866227) I was born in South Africa and moved to Australia in December 2016. I finished high school in 2019 at Sandringham College and am currently doing a Bachelors of IT at RMIT.

              <br>
            I speak two languages fluently, Afrikaans is my home language and I speak it whenever I’m with family. English is my second language and I speak that everywhere else. I was a competitive dancer for 9 years, mainly doing contemporary and modern but I did both rhythmic gymnastics and classical ballet for a year each. I have two brothers (one older and one younger). My email address is s3866227@student.rmit.edu.au.
