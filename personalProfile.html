      <h3 class="page5">What these results mean to me:</h3>
      <p1>
        For me this means that as an introvert I have a harder time meeting new people and need my own time away from a group in order to recharge, I am also more of a visual learner so this will help me identify ways in which I can learn most effectively.
        <br><br>
        My strengths include; being open-minded about things, having an objective viewpoint and being honest and straightforward. My weaknesses include; being withdrawn, being insensitive, sometimes being condescending, loathing rules and guidelines and second guessing myself. These results also help me to understand myself better and have an outside perspective on where my strengths and weaknesses lie. <br> <br><br>
      </p1>
      <h3 class="page5">How these results might influence my behaviour in a team:</h3>
      <p1>
        Within a team setting I will likely serve as finding a logical means to solve the problem at hand however, I will most probably struggle when it comes to actually working with other people due to the aforementioned weaknesses such as second guessing myself and what I have to offer as well as being withdrawn. I will also be more open about implementing the ideas other put forward and show willingness to use these ideas in whatever way possible. <br> <br> <br>
      </p1>
      <h3 class="page 5">How should I take the results into account when forming a team:</h3>
      <p1>
        I need to form a team with people who complement as well as challenge my personality in order to allow for diverse opinions and ideas but also to allow for a cooperative and productive environment.
        <br><br>
        I would also have to keep in mind how my weaknesses can affect teamwork and consciously try to avoid succumbing to these weaknesses in order to meet the end goal of the team.  My teammates should have differing strengths and weaknesses so that where one falls short the other excels in order to fill any gaps that might appear by any one individualsâ€™ weakness.
        <br><br><br>
      </p1>
      <h3 class="page5">Validity of the results:</h3>
      <p1>
        While these results are a good indicator of where I stand personality wise, it is important to remember that because these are online tests, they are not entirely accurate. For example - the learning style test's questions were too obviously tied to a result which could cause a user tochoose an answer that may not be true to them but will give them their desired result. It is also worth noting that sometimes questions are vague or can be interpreted differently than intended which can also influence the accuracy of the reults.
