    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <p1>My project idea is an app that allows a user to download, as well as translate, sewing patterns into whatever language they desire and store it in a library as a PDF so that they can access it anytime and anywhere.
      <br><br>
    I will be coding it from scratch in a language such as Java using a platform such as Eclipse IDE and it will be made available for both IOS and Android it will also be available on phones and tablets. The app will require a decent connection to the internet due to the downloading process. More detail is provided under the ‘Description’ header.<br><br><br></p1>
    <h3>Motivation:</h3>
    <p1>Seamstresses have always either had to have a printed-out copy of the patterns they want and store it physically or they have had to go through the effort of searching and saving patterns onto a computer or phone and often lose track of what they have downloaded and what they haven’t.
      <br><br>
    The idea for language translation being involved stems from the fact that many sewing patterns are in other languages (such as Spanish or Chinese) which makes them basically impossible to use if you don’t know that language – thus making the search for patterns even more unnecessarily complicated for seamstresses.<br><br><br></p1>
    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p1>The user will download this app which acts like a library, the app automatically searches the web for sewing patterns and the user can search through the app for what they need, and the app searches the web for it and displays all possible results. Once the user has found what they are looking for they can download the pattern as a PDF and, if necessary, the app can translate the instructions into their desired language. <br><br>The app stores the PDF in a library and users can create folders or sub-libraries in order to organise their library. There will also be an option to access an appendix-like feature which gives them access to sewing terminology and their definitions as well as examples when appropriate (such has how a certain stitch would look). There would also be a search bar within the users’ library in order to make navigation a bit easier, the app will have basic functions such as a menu tab which has links to different aspects of the app such as the main library or any sub libraries the user may have decided to create, the appendix, and it will also have help tab where users can find FAQ or – if needed – contact me. <br><br>The app will need to have internet connection whether through mobile data or WIFI, if mobile data is being used there will be a warning popup saying that mobile data is being used in case users forgot to turn their WIFI on, this is to avoid users unknowingly using data on downloads. Some drawbacks I would expect to encounter would be that the translation aspect of the app could be very complicated, as well as storage issues if a user downloads a lot of patterns the app would need to be optimised in order to avoid crashes or slow loading.<br><br>Other drawbacks I can expect would be the app searching the internet as it should know what to look for and where to get it which may be complicated – otherwise I will have to settle with the user manually downloading from the internet and then importing it into their library or to have a bar where the user copies the link from their desired pattern and the app will then do the rest. <br><br><br></p1>
    <h3>Tools and technologies:</h3>
    <p1>I will need a platform to program the app such as Eclipse IDE, I will also need my laptop in order to run this program and code the app. <br><br>I will also be using an external hard drive in order to back up my progress just in case something goes wrong with my laptop so that I will not need to start over if I have made a lot of progress. <br><br><br></p1>
    <h3>Skills required:</h3>
    <p1>I will need to proficient in a coding language such as Java in order to be able to program the app from scratch. I will also need to be able to design the interface of the app in order to make it look appealing to the users. <br><br>These skills won’t be incredibly difficult to learn as there as countless resources available online and in books however, I will have to dedicate a lot of time to practising these skills in order to get to the desired skill level needed to make this process as smooth and as hassle free as possible.<br><br><br></p1>
    <h3>Outcome:</h3>
    <p1>For the outcome I would hope to see a fully functioning app following the description I write before. It should be able to run on Android and IOS devices with minimal problems however it is expected that there will be a few issues to deal with especially with the first version of the app. <br><br>The app will be free to download on both the app store and on the google play store and will be available in as many countries as possible. My goal is to make getting and organising sewing patterns less of a daunting task to seamstresses around the world. <br><br><br></p1>
