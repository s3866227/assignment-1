          <h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline IT experience: <br><br></h3>
            <p1>My interest in IT started from a young age with my dad, he has always had a keen  interest  in all things computers and that has been passed on to each of his kids – including me. I would watch him teach my older brother how to game and my brother taught me. From there I would play video games with my brothers and subsequently my friends, however I wouldn’t consider myself a ‘gamer’ by any means as it is mostly something I do to kill time and it isn’t my main hobby.

              I have always wanted to learn how to program but never had the right motivation and therefore wouldn’t get very far with it. I like to think my interest stems from how seemingly small things such as phones can do so much and store so much information. Growing up with technology and seeing the advancements made every day has always piqued my interest and it’s something I would love to learn more about and be able to understand the complexities thereof.

          <h3 class="rmitHeader">Why did you choose to come to RMIT?<br> <br></h3>
          <p1>I chose RMIT because it has a good reputation here in Melbourne, it’s also close to home (if I wasn’t doing online) and I have a few friends that are attending RMIT for different courses and they really enjoy the work they’re doing and found it easy to adapt.

           I was originally planning on attending university on-campus however my family moved to a new house a bit further away from the CBD and while attending on-campus was still possible, it would’ve taken a lot of time to commute there and back and I decided doing online was the best option for me. While browsing through the available universities available for my course I decided that RMIT was the best option for me.
